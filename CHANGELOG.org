* V0.2.0
** Backend Changes
- Add *vampir* to the =all_compilers= flag, as it properly compiles
- split *vampir* into halo2 and plonk, as we now have 2 different
  vampir backends
- Triton upgraded to version v0.33!
- Risc0 upgraded to v0.18.0!
** Benchmarking Changes
- Reduce the sample size to 10, as running all the benchmarks takes
  quite a while.
** Miscellaneous Changes
- Removed old log files
- Moved to rust stable for the locked toolchain
